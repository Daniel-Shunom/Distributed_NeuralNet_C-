## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated distributed neural network architecture where each network layer's computations are distributed and validated through a consensus mechanism for propagation.

## 🚀 Installation

Get started with the project by following these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Shunom/Distributed_NeuralNet_C-.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd DNN_

# Install dependencies
make install
```

## 💻 Usage

Implement the Propagation library functions to configure network parameters and hyperparameters:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "yourproject.h"

int main() {
    YourProject project;
    project.run();
    return 0;
}
```
